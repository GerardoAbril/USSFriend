# Portable Network Monitoring

The backend for the portable network monitoring system.

To use this, either ensure your mysql admin username is `root` and your mysql admin password is `rock64`, or change the corresponding lines of code in the Perl scripts to be accurate to your mysql admin credentials.  

Blocklist.pl should run automatically; however, packcap.pl must be run for each ethernet port that will be sniffed after the ports are properly assigned IP addresses.
